<h2>VOCES POPULI.</h2>

<h3>AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY.</h3>

<h4><span class="sc">In the Vestibule.</span></h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Visitors ascending staircase, full of enthusiasm and energetic determination
not to miss a single Picture, encounter people descending
in various stages of mental and physical exhaustion. At the
turnstiles two Friends meet unexpectedly; both being shy men,
who, with timely notice, would have preferred to avoid one
another, their greetings are marked by an unnatural effusion,
and followed by embarrassed silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Shy Man &nbsp;&nbsp;(to break the spell).</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Odd, our running up against
one another like this, eh?</p>

<p><i>Second Shy Man.</i> Oh, very odd. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Looks about him irresolutely,
and wonders if it would be decent to pass on. Decides it will hardly
do.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Great place for meeting, the Academy, though.</p>

<p><i>First S. M.</i> Yes; sure to come across <i>somebody</i>, sooner or later.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a href="images/265-450.png"><img src="images/265-250.png" width="250" height="423" alt="advertising the exhibition" /></a></div>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Laughs nervously, and wishes the other would go.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Second S. M. &nbsp;&nbsp;(seeing that his friend lingers).</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This your <i>first</i>
visit here?</p>

<p><i>First S. M.</i> Yes. Couldn't very well get away <i>before</i>, you know.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Feels apologetic, without exactly knowing why.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Second S. M.</i> It's <i>my</i> first visit, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Sees no escape, and resigns
himself.</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;Er&mdash;we may as well go round together, eh?</p>

<p><i>First S. M. &nbsp;&nbsp;(who was afraid this was coming&mdash;heartily).</i>
Good! By the way, I always think, on a
first visit, it's best to take a single room, and do that
thoroughly. &nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>This has only just occurred to him.</i></p>

<p><i>Second S. M. &nbsp;&nbsp;(who had been intending to follow that
plan himself).</i> Oh, <i>do</i> you? Now, for <i>my</i> part, I
don't attempt to see anything <i>thoroughly</i> the first
time. Just scamper through, glance at the things
one oughtn't to miss, get a general impression, and
come away. <i>Then</i>, if I don't happen to come again,
I've always <i>done</i> it, you see. But &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>considerately</i>),
&nbsp;&nbsp;look here. Don't let me drag you about, if you'd
rather not!</p>

<p><i>First S. M.</i> Oh, but I shouldn't like to feel I was
any tie on you. Don't you mind about me. I shall
potter about in here&mdash;for hours, I daresay.</p>

<p><i>Second S. M.</i> Ah, well &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>with vague consolation</i>), &nbsp;&nbsp;I
shall always know where to <i>find</i> you, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>First S. M.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>brightening visibly</i>). &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh dear, yes; <i>I</i>
shan't be far away.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>They part with mutual relief, only tempered by the
necessity of following the course they have respectively
prescribed for themselves. Nemesis overtakes
the</i> Second S. M. <i>in the next Gallery, when he is
captured by a Desultory Enthusiast, who insists
upon dragging him all over the place to see obscure "bits" and
"gems," which are only to be appreciated by ricking the neck or
stooping painfully</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>A Suburban Lady (to Female Friend).</i> Oh dear, <i>how</i> stupid of me!
I <i>quite</i> forgot to bring a pencil! Oh, <i>thank</i> you, dear, that will
do <i>beautifully</i>. It's just a <i>little</i> blunt; but so long as I can
<i>mark</i> with it, you know. You don't think we should avoid the crush if we
began at the end room? Well, perhaps it <i>is</i> less confusing to begin
at the beginning, and work steadily through.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">In Gallery No. I.</span></h4>

<blockquote><p><i>A small group has collected before</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Wyllie's</span> "Davy Jones's
Locker," <i>which they inspect solemnly for some time before venturing
to commit themselves to any opinion</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Visitor (after devoting his whole mind to the subject).</i> Why,
it's the Bottom of the Sea&mdash;at least (<i>more cautiously</i>), that's what
it seems to be <i>intended</i> for.</p>

<p><i>Second V.</i> Ah, and very well done, too. I wonder, now, how he
managed to stay down long enough to paint all that?</p>

<p><i>Third V.</i> Practice, I suppose. I've seen writing done under
water myself. But that was a tank!</p>

<p><i>Fourth V. (presumably in profound allusion to the fishes and
sea-anemones).</i>
Well, they seem to be 'aving it all their own way down
there, don't they?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>The Group, feeling that this remark sums up
the situation, disperses.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Suburban Lady (her pencil in full play).</i> No. 93. Now what's
<i>that</i> about? Oh, "<i>Forbidden Sweets</i>,"&mdash;yes, to be sure. <i>Isn't</i>
that
charming? Those two dear little tots having their tea, and the
kitten with its head stuck in the jam-pot, and the label and all, and
the sticky spoon on the nursery table-cloth&mdash;so <i>natural</i>! I really
<i>must</i> mark that. (<i>Awards this distinction.</i>) 97. "<i>Going up
Top.</i>"
Yes, <i>of course</i>. Look, <span class="sc">Lucy</span> dear, that little fellow has just
answered
a question, and his master tells him he may go to the top of the class,
do you <i>see</i>? And the big boy looking so sulky, he's wishing he had
learnt his lesson better. I do think it's <i>so</i> clever&mdash;all the different
expressions. Yes, I shall <i>certainly</i> mark that!</p>

<h3><span class="sc">In Gallery No. II.</span></h3>

<p><span class="ind"><i>The S. L. (doubtfully).</i></span> H'm, No. 156. "<i>Cloud Chariots</i>"? Not
very <i>like</i> chariots, though, <i>are</i> they?</p>

<p><i>Her Friend.</i> I expect it's one of those sort of pictures that you
have to look at a long time, and then things gradually come <i>out</i> of
it, you know.</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> It may be. (<i>Tries the experiment.</i>) No, <i>I</i> can't
make
<i>anything</i> come out&mdash;only just clouds and their reflections. (<i>Struggling
between good-nature and conscientiousness.</i>) I <i>don't</i> think I
<i>can</i>
mark that.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">In Gallery No. III.</span></h3>

<p><span class="ind"><i>A Matron (before</i></span> Mr. <span class="sc">Dicksee's</span> "<i>Tannhäuser</i>"). "<i>Venus
and
Tannhäuser</i>"&mdash;ah, and is that Venus on the stretcher? Oh, <i>that's</i>
her all on fire in the background. Then which is Tannhäuser, and
what are they all supposed to be doing? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>In a tone of irritation.</i></p>

<p><i>Her Nephew.</i> Oh, it tells you all about it in the Catalogue&mdash;he
meets her funeral, you know, and leaves grow on his stick.</p>

<p><i>The Matron (pursing her lips).</i> Oh, a <i>dead person</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Repulses the Catalogue severely and passes on.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Person, with an "Eye for Art" (before "Pysche's Bath,"
by the President).</i> Not bad, eh?</p>

<p><i>Second Person, &amp;c.</i> No, I rather like it. (<i>Feels that he is growing
too lenient.</i>) He doesn't give you a very good idea of marble,
though.</p>

<p><i>First P. &amp;c.</i> No&mdash;<i>that's</i> not marble, and he always
puts too many folds in his drapery to suit <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><i>First P. &amp;c.</i> Just what <i>I</i> always say. It's not
natural, you know.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>They pass on, much pleased with themselves and one another.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fiançé'">Fiancé</ins> (halting before a sea-scape, by</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Henry
Moore</span>, <i>to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fiançée'">Fiancée</ins></i>). Here, I say, hold on a bit&mdash;what's
<i>this</i> one?</p>

<p><i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fiançée'">Fiancée</ins> (who doesn't mean to waste the whole afternoon
over pictures).</i> Why, it's only a lot of waves&mdash;<i>come</i>
on!</p>

<p><i>The Surburban L.</i> <span class="sc">Lucy</span>, <i>this</i> is rather nice.
"<i>Breakfasts for the Porth!</i>" (<i>Pondering.</i>) I think
there must be a mistake in the Catalogue&mdash;I don't see
any breakfast things&mdash;they're cleaning fish, and
what's a "Porth!" Would you mark that&mdash;or not?</p>

<p><i>Her Comp.</i> Oh, I <i>think</i> so.</p>

<p><i>The S. L.</i> I don't know. I've marked such a
quantity already and the lead won't hold out much
longer. Oh, it's by <span class="sc">Hook</span>, R. A. Then I suppose it's
<i>sure</i> to be all right. I've marked it, dear.</p>

<p><i>Duet by Two Dreadfully Severe Young Ladies,
who paint a little on China.</i> Oh, my <i>dear</i>, look at that.
Did you ever see such a thing? Isn't it too perfectly
<i>awful</i>? And there's a thing! Do come and look at
this horror over here. A "<i>Study</i>," indeed. I should just think it
<i>was</i>! Oh, <span class="sc">Maggie</span>, don't be so satirical, or I shall die! No, but
<i>do</i>
just see this&mdash;isn't it <i>killing?</i> They get worse and worse every year,
I declare!</p>
<blockquote><p class="ind1">[<i>And so on.</i></p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="sc">In Gallery No. V.</span></h3>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Two Prosaic Persons come upon a little picture, by</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Swan</span>,
<i>of a boy lying on a rock, piping to fishes.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p><i>First P. P.</i> <i>That's</i> a rum thing!</p>

<p><i>Second P. P.</i> Yes, I wasn't aware myself that fishes were so
partial to music.</p>

<p><i>First P. P.</i> They may be&mdash;out there&mdash;(<i>perceiving that the boy is
unclad</i>)&mdash;but it's peculiar altogether&mdash;they look like herrings to me.</p>

<p><i>Second P. P.</i> Yes&mdash;or mackerel. But (<i>tolerantly</i>) I suppose it's
a fancy subject.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>They consider that this absolves them from taking
any further interest in it, and pass on.</i></p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="sc">In Gallery No. XI.</span></h3>

<p><span class="ind"><i>An Old Lady (who judges Art from a purely Moral Standpoint,

<p><i>The S. L. (her enthusiasm greatly on the wane, and her temper

<h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

<h3>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="sc">I am</span> told that many of the
millions who have read with delight
the brilliant sporting articles
that have appeared from my pen
week after week expect me to utter
a few words of seasonable advice
as to the chances of the various
animals engaged in the Derby and
the Oaks. If I were one of the
chowder-headed numskulls who
cackle for hire, the task would
doubtless be an easy one. Mr. J.
has performed it yearly with that
magnificent want of success which
attends all his addle-pated efforts.
But, praise be to Heaven! I am
not Mr. J., or one of his crew. I
am only a humble writer, distinguished
alike for his unerring
sagacity, his undeviating accuracy,
and his incisive force of expression.
My task is, therefore,
stupendous, but I will perform it.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">The Derby.</span></h3>

<p>There are many horses in for the
Derby. Some people fancy <i>Surefoot</i>.
Fancies are not, of course,
facts, but the name is good. Keep
your eye on the black and cerise
of <span class="sc">Liddiard</span>. <i>Sainfoin</i> is not
generally supposed to cover grass,
but there are generally exceptions.
I have not heard the angels calling
<i>Le Nord</i> lately, but they may
begin at any time. A man may
get <i>home</i>, so may a horse, and I am
bound to say that if I were <i>The
Beggar</i> I should give the lie to the
crack-brained puddling proverb,
and be a chooser of first place.
<i>Bel Demonio</i> should be all there
when the first part of his name
rings, so that he may go like the
second, if he wants to be one, two,
or three. <i>Rathbeal</i> rhymes to heel.
Has he got a clean pair to show?
<i>Orwell</i> should score well; and you
must never, tie your <i>Garter</i> too
tightly, unless you want to stop
your circulation. <i>Golden Gate</i> is
not always as open as might be
wished; and <i>The Imp</i> is sometimes
a hindrance. Good old <i>Polonius</i>!
As for <i>Kirkham</i>, <i>Alloway</i>,
<i>Martagon</i>, and <i>Loup</i>, all I can say
is, Mum's the word. How about
the Field? Monkeys are often
made there. So much for the Derby.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">The Oaks.</span></h3>

<p>Who said <i>Semolina</i>? Passion,
passion take advice, fill your
pockets fall of <i>Semolina</i>. Ha, ha!
<i>Signorina</i> ought certainly not to
miss the mark by more than a
mile. <i>Mémoire</i> might do <i>pour
servir</i>, and <i>Goldwing</i> sounds well
for a flyer. Those who cross the
<i>Ponza (sinorum)</i> generally go further
with ease, and <i>Dearest</i> is
certainly superlative. The Field
a monkey. Who said that? Whoever
he was, let him beware! That
is all I have to say in the meantime,
but anyone desiring further
information is requested to apply
to me by letter at the office, enclosing
twelve clean stamps for a
reply. All who are not in a state
of niddy-noddying, anserous,
asinine, gruel-brained, pumpkin-faced,
gooseberry-eyed imbecility,
will, of course, do so.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Though the topic of Africa is said to be 'embarrassing
and inconvenient,' it need not occasion
any uneasiness at all; but if the British Government
surrenders any portion of the territory
reserved for the sphere of British influence, it may
become most terribly embarrassing within a
measurable period of time."&mdash;<i>Stanley's Reply to

<h2>THE BITTER CRY OF THE LONDON RIDER HAGGARD AND JADED.</h2>

<p><i>the Chief Commissioners of
Works, The Ditto of Police,
and to "George" Ranger.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Why</span> not open up rides
in Kensington Gardens?
Say one good one under the
trees from South-West to
North-West, and connect
Kensington with Bayswater?
Will any benefactor
to unfortunate Metropolitan
Equestrians force
this North-West passage?</p>

<p>There is a meagre ride
at the side of the road in
the Inner Circle, Regent's
Park. Why not a good ride
right across Park? From
considerable observation
and experience of Kensington
Gardens and Regent's
Park, it may be confidently
asserted, that such rides as
are here proposed, would
not interfere with the comfort
of a single (or married)
nurse or governess with children in her charge. Both places are
comparatively unfrequented, and the proposed rides would not
infringe upon the recreation of the London boys.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend the Chief Commissioner to visit Paris,
and, mounted upon a comfortable horse, let him make the acquaintance
of the delightful <i>sentiers</i> laid out as rides in the Bois de
Boulogne. This will be a first-rate French exercise for him, and
he will learn a great deal from it. The <span class="sc">Duke</span>, who is fond of
equitation, especially in Battersea Park, must admit that the equestrians
of London are very badly off for variety. Up and down Rotten
Row, once into the siding by the Barracks, once to the dismal ride
on the North side, and once back again by the ride that opens on
to the Mausoleum-like Magazine,&mdash;which of all London Magazines
is the dreariest,&mdash;this, and only this, is the daily burden of the
patient London rider's song. "How long? How long?" as Mr.
<span class="sc">Wilson Barrett</span> used to be always exclaiming in <i>The Silver King</i>,
or <i>Claudian</i>, or both. How long&mdash;will mounted London put up with
this, which is the reverse of a merry-go-round?</p>

<p>Then we have to be thankful for the small mercy of a narrow strip
of a ride, barely room for one, along Constitution Hill, and for that
other strip, a trifle wider, in Birdcage Walk, which is always
crowded with children, and one might as well be riding through
nursery grounds. Why shouldn't there be here a cut right across
the grass, from The Walk of the Birdcages to middle of Piccadilly?</p>

<p>If <span class="sc">George Ranger</span>, the Chief Commissioner of Police, and the
Chief of the Board of Works would combine, we might get something
done which would benefit the riders&mdash;riders haggard and jaded&mdash;and
materially assist the smallest circulation (possessed by those who ride
to live) in the world. There is one thing that ought to be put down,
and put down with a strong hand,&mdash;and that is plenty of gravel at
all the gates; but especially round and about the Marble Arch, which
is a most dangerously slippery pass.</p>

<h3>RAILWAY UNPUNCTUALITY REPORT;</h3>

<h4><i>Or, What it may probably come to.</i></h4>

<p><span class="sc">That</span> the new Legislation has begun to tell favourably on the
conduct of the traffic of the leading lines cannot for a moment be
doubted after glancing at the thirteenth Bi-weekly Record, published
at the Companies' expense, according to the Provisions of the
recent Act, on the back of all their passenger-tickets. It is satisfactory
to note how, in something like six weeks, punctuality in the
train service seems really almost established, the only train arriving
one minute late being one of the Edinburgh Expresses, of which the
boiler of the engine blew up at Grantham, thereby causing a little
delay, which, however, was picked up before the conclusion of the
run by extra steaming. The heavy penal system which the new
Legislation has introduced, is, of course, answerable for this
delightful change; but a glance at the following table for the six
weeks since the Act has come into operation, will show how
effectively and rapidly it has worked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">* Precautionary sentence.</p>

<p>The list of officials, as furnished in the above Schedule, undergoing
their various periods of punishment, is an encouraging sign
to the travelling public, and it is satisfactory to notice that the old
unpunctuality that marked the first week, followed up as it was <i>by
a rigorous application of the new law</i>, instantly disappeared as if by
magic, when the Companies began really to understand their <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'responbilities'">responsibilities</ins>
and their penalties under the new Act. It is confidently,
therefore, to be hoped, that next week's record may possibly be an
entirely clean one, and that, <i>the only method of ensuring punctuality</i>,
namely, the infliction of a penalty on the Authorities who can control
it, may be found in practice to be entirely successful.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 26.</i>&mdash;Faust. Faust-rate performance as far as

is far
too knowing a <i>Marguérite</i>. The simple
<i>Faust</i>, just beginning life, is evidently
no match for this guileless young lady.
Being "no match for her" is probably
the reason for his not marrying her.
<span class="sc">Nordica</span> charming vocally, but dramatically
there is too much of the <i>Becky
Sharp</i> about her, and she is merely in
a plot with <i>Martha</i> to let in the rich
and spoony Juggins called <i>Faust</i>.
New man, <span class="sc">Franceschetti</span>, as <i>Valentine</i>,
not quite the thing: perhaps
nervous seeing <span class="sc">Dan Drady</span> in front
looking at him. Good house for Whit

Always thought <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> was
Boss of this Show. Better change name
to <i>Y-not-bos</i>, and the answer will come
from <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> himself, "Iboss." Monsieur <span class="sc">Ybos</span> belongs to
the school of Signor <span class="sc">Vibrato</span>. Energetic but too angry with

Madame <span class="sc">Tetrazzini</span> a dramatic <i>Valentina</i>. <span class="sc">Dan Drady</span> a

trouble and expense to master the plot. An idea strikes me.
I shall publish <i>Examination Papers on Popular Operas</i>. What

<p><span class="sc">Act I.</span>&mdash;Why is <i>Raoul</i>
blindfolded?</p>

<p>What is <i>Miss Valentine</i>
doing in somebody else's

<p class="center1">[<i>Shakes himself, and her at the same time.</i>]</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Act. II.</span>&mdash;Account for
the dresses of the bathing-women
who come in and
dance before the Queen.
Where are the machines?</p>

<p>What is the Page's song,
"<i>No, no, no, no!</i>" about?</p>

<p>Is <i>Raoul</i> in love with the Queen, or the Queen with <i>Raoul</i>? In
either case account reasonably for the subsequent conduct of each of
them.</p>

<p>What is the Queen singing about at commencement of Act?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Act III.</span>&mdash;What is <i>Valentine</i> doing out in the streets, in a
wedding-dress,
late at night?</p>

<p>Why do the women turn their backs on the church when they
kneel in the streets to say their prayers? Is there no more kneeling-room
inside the church? If so, why are people still being admitted
while the women are kneeling outside? What service should you
say was going on?</p>

<p>Where do the Maritanas with tambourines all come from? And
why? Are they the bathing-women in another costume? If so,
show their connection with the plot.</p>

<p>After the curfew has sounded, and a man with a lantern has sent
everyone to bed, why do all the people suddenly come out of bed
again, every one of them all dressed and ready for anything?</p>

<p>What is the Queen doing riding about the town at night on a
white horse?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Act IV.</span>&mdash;Don't you think the Conspirators are very simple-minded
people, not to look behind the curtain where <i>Raoul</i> is hidden?
What have the nuns to do with the blessing of the daggers?
Wouldn't they be rather in the way in a conspiracy?</p>

<p>On what storey does the action of Act IV. take place, and what is
the height from the ground that <i>Raoul</i> has to leap when he jumps
out of the window?</p>

<p>There used to be a Fifth Act, with a grand <i>trio</i> and <i>chorale</i>, what
has become of it? If played, does anyone stop to hear it? If not
played, can audience sue the management, or demand their money
back?</p>

position for the sleep-walking heroine in bed-room scene, when
the Covent Garden Cat (who was in front last Tuesday night,
when she ran round the ledge of the pit tier in humble imitation of
little <span class="sc">Laurie</span> at Pantomime time) suddenly rushes from under the
bed, and after nearly frightening into fits naughty little <span class="sc">Lisa

quietly across the stage, and makes a good exit <span class="sc">R.</span> 2. <span class="sc">E.</span> Count
<span class="sc">Edouard</span>, in commencement-of-nineteenth-century hat and coat,
finished off with trousers and patent-leather boots of date A.D. 1890,
much amused. <i>Amina</i> supposed to be walking in her sleep, can't
possibly take notice of animal, but House in chuckles, as an audience
always is, whenever the harmless and quite unnecessary cat appears
upon the stage. <i>Rentrée</i> of <span class="sc">Ravelli</span>, in first-rate voice.
Everyone
charmed with him, and with <span class="sc">Ned de Reszké</span>. Signor <span class="sc">Rinaldino</span> an
amusing <i>Alessio</i>, and Madame <span class="sc">Sinico</span> tunefully affectionate as the
devoted and sympathetic Mamma of the Aminable heroine. Melodies
of our childhood, delightful to hear them again; and the good old-fashioned
Italian Opera terminations to the choruses admirably
rendered.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;"<i>Dr. Faust</i>, I presume?" I wasn't there. Opera went
on, I believe, in my absence.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;<i>La Traviata.</i> <span class="sc">Ella Russell</span> at her best. Tenor
<span class="sc">Montariol</span> not quite at his best as that despicable character
<i>Alfredo</i>.
M. <span class="sc">Palermini</span> (why not "Old Pal"?) very good as <i>Giorgio Germont</i>.
The magnificently-attired chorus enjoy themselves amazingly at
supper in Act I., for <i>Violetta</i>, when she does do the thing, does it
well, and there are certainly not less than four bottles of champagne
among a hundred guests.</p>

<p><i>Questions for Examination Paper.</i>&mdash;At whose house does this
supper-party take place? Why do all the guests leave at once?
Why is everyone in a Charles the Second costume except <i>Violetta</i>,
who is in fashionable evening dress of 1890? Who is the young lady
whom <i>Violetta</i> so affectionately kisses? and what, if anything, has
she to do with the plot?</p>

<p><i>In Act III.</i>&mdash;Is it a <i>bal masqué</i>? If not, what is it, and where?
What is the simple game of cards which <i>Alfredo</i> plays with such
enthusiasm? Who wins? and how much?</p>

<h3>DERBY DISAPPOINTMENTS.</h3>

<h4>To go to Epsom with a view to a day's enjoyment.</h4>

<p>To imagine that there is any sport on the
road down, and ditto returning.</p>

<p>To believe that a heavy lunch of lukewarm
lobster salad and simmering champagne can
be taken with impunity.</p>

<p>To fancy that one can get into a train bound
for the Downs without losing one's temper.</p>

<p>To think that there is any fun in listening
to the ribald songs of street nigger minstrels
and Shoreditch gipsies.</p>

<p>To expect that, after taking part in half a
dozen drag sweeps, any one of them will turn
up trumps.</p>

<p>To presume that you will neither be choked
with dust nor drenched with rain before you
get home.</p>

<p>Lastly, to back the Winner for £10,000,
payable by the Bank of England, to draw the
right number at all the West-End Clubs to

betrothed to the only and lovely daughter
of a millionnaire Duke, and then (on waking)

<h2>THE BALLAD OF THE EARL'S BREEKS.</h2>

<p class="ind1">
"I am wearing a pair of Co-operative trousers."&mdash;<i>Lord Rosebery, at
Congress of Delegates from the Co-operative Societies of Great Britain and
Ireland, meeting at Glasgow.</i>
</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Talk</span> of Dual Garmenture! Here's a picture, to be sure,</p>
<p class="i2">That a pleasanter, more potent lesson teaches.</p>
<p>Croakers given to foolish fright might take courage at the sight</p>
<p class="i2">Of Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery's</span> Co-operative Breeches!</p>
<p>For our Earl's a canny chief, and the timidest must feel</p>
<p class="i2">That by what he advocates no sort of hurt is meant;</p>
<p>And if anybody wants true co-operative pants,</p>
<p class="i2">He'll be glad to read Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery's</span> advertisement.</p>
<p>Co-operation now frightens very few, I trow,</p>
<p class="i2">(Who wear trousers); but a few years earlier? Bless us!</p>
<p>Such breeks would have been bogies to a lot of frightened fogies,</p>
<p class="i2">They would just as soon have donned the shirt of Nessus.</p>
<p>Now an Earl to Glasgow goes, 'midst the men once thought our foes,</p>
<p class="i2">And about Co-operation learns&mdash;and also teaches;</p>
<p>And receives with genial glee from the Tweed Society</p>
<p class="i2">A pair of Tweed Co-operative Breeches!</p>
<p>Why eighty-six per cent. (at Clackmannan) are intent,</p>
<p class="i2">(Nearly nine-tenths of all its population),</p>
<p>In a fashion fair as stout, upon fully working out</p>
<p class="i2">The principles of true Co-operation.</p>
<p>Yet there are no earthquakes there, and Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery</span> in the chair</p>
<p class="i2">At the Congress of Co-operative Delegates,</p>
<p>Talks in tones of hearty cheer, and the very thought of fear</p>
<p class="i2">To a Limbo Fatuorum calmly relegates.</p>
<p>Members One million men, with a capital of <i>Ten</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">And an annual sale of close on <i>Thirty Seven</i>!</p>
<p>Two millions more each year! Yes, it's truly pretty clear</p>
<p class="i2">That the State feels the co-operative leaven.</p>
<p>And though it is mere hum to see the Millennium,</p>
<p class="i2">Because Co-operators cheerfully co-operate,</p>
<p>Yet it <i>is</i> a mighty movement, and our hopes of Earth's improvement</p>
<p class="i2">May rise with it, at a prudent and a proper rate.</p>
<p>Pooh! the pessimistic dreams of pragmatical Earl <span class="sc">Wemyss</span></p>
<p class="i2">May well excite this sager Earl's derision.</p>
<p>Forty Millions total profit! No, we are <i>not</i> nearing Tophet,</p>
<p class="i2">Any more than we are touching realms Elysian.</p>
<p>Those on Co-Ops so sweet and shopkeepers need not treat</p>
<p class="i2">Each other like the cats of old Kilkenny,</p>
<p>From each other they might learn, live together and all turn,</p>
<p class="i2">With sagacity and skill, an honest penny.</p>
<p>There's no need for any gush, but "The Principle" will push</p>
<p class="i2">As Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery</span> foreshadows to high places;</p>
<p>And it was not all his fun when he hinted we might run</p>
<p class="i2">Our Empire on co-operative bases!</p>
<p>They who want to understand what is stirring in the land,</p>
<p class="i2">Should peruse <span class="sc">Primrose's</span> pithiest of speeches,</p>
<p>Meanwhile <i>Punch</i> drinks good health to the "Labourer's Commonwealth,"</p>
<p class="i2">And long wear to those Co-operative Breeches!</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;The Derby. <i>Mr. Punch</i> out for the day. Party at
Foreign Office to meet Mr. <span class="sc">Stanley</span> unavoidably postponed.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Trying to recover from Derby Day.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Private Eclipse of the Sun. For tickets to view, inquire at
Timekeeper's Office, Charing Cross. Only a limited number will
be issued.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury's</span> first dance to meet Mr.
<span class="sc">Stanley</span>.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Social</span> festivities which were much disturbed by the Whitsuntide
holidays, have now been resumed in all their splendour. The Mile
End Athenæum yesterday held their annual reception in the palatial
institution designed for the accommodation of the intellectual <i>élite</i>
of the district. The rooms were crowded from an early hour.
Proceedings began with an address on "The Æsthetic Position of
Mile End," delivered by the President. This was followed by some
graceful step-dancing, executed by two stars from the neighbouring
Hall of Variety. Later on the guests, having, as is usual, exchanged
over-coats, and tossed with the Club halfpenny for umbrellas,
separated to their homes.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lady <span class="sc">Clementina Cropper</span> has issued cards for a musical evening
at which all the most eminent performers are expected. The
Whistling Quintette and the Whispering Choir have been engaged.
Her Ladyship's parties are famous for the animation and brilliancy
of their conversation.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is understood that the Stewards of the Jockey Club at their
last meeting resolved to suppress the use of all strong language on
Derby Day. Any owner discovered in the act of saying "blow"
will be confined to barracks for a fortnight. Anything more violent
will involve perpetual suspension, with the loss of all the privileges
of a British Citizen. Any jockey denouncing his neighbour's eyes
will be converted into an automatic toffee-distributor. If he repeats
the offence, he will be forbidden to vote at the next County Council
Election. These salutary regulations will be strictly enforced.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Railway Companies anticipate no difficulty in conveying
visitors to Epsom within two hours of the time fixed for their
arrival. Much interest attaches to some novel experiments in shunting,
which are to be carried out between Epsom and London to-day.
The point is to discover whether an excursion train loaded with
passengers at the rate of thirty to a carriage designed for eight, can
be shunted into a siding so as to clear an express moving at a constant
velocity of fifty miles an hour, drinks included. The pace of
the excursion train may be neglected in the solution of the problem.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I have never understood," says a Correspondent, who signs himself
"<span class="sc">Puzzled</span>," "why a dog should always use his left hind-leg
for the purpose of scratching his left ear, and <i>vice versâ</i> his right leg
for his right ear. Can any of your readers enlighten me?"</p>

<h3>EXCHELSIOR!</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Told</span> that I can "assist
the progress of Military
Science" if I go up in a
"War Balloon" at Chelsea.
Don't know anything
about ballooning,
but do want to assist
Military Science.</p>

<p>Arrive at Chelsea Exhibition
Grounds. See the
Balloon being inflated.
Disappointed, as a "War
Balloon" seems to be
exactly the same as a
Peace Balloon. Expected
it to be armour-plated, or
fitted with aërial torpedoes,
or something of that
sort. Ask Professional
Aëronaut if I mayn't take
a bomb up with me, and
drop it, as practice for war
time? Aëronaut scowls
fiercely. Asks, "If I
want to blow the Balloon
to smithereens?" Also
asks, "If I have any
bombs about me now?"
Looks as if he would like
to search me! Drop the
subject&mdash;not the bomb.
Still, I <i>should</i> like to know
how I can "assist Military
Science." Take my place
in car nervously.</p>

<p>Somebody shouts, "Let
go!" What an extraordinary sensation! Feel as if I had suddenly left
digestive portion of my anatomy a mile below me. Have felt same sort of
thing in crossing Channel. Look over edge of car. Appalling! Wish I
hadn't been such a fool as to come. Ask Professional Aëronaut, "What
would happen if a rope broke now?" He replies, sulkily, "your neck
would break too." Not comforting. Question is&mdash;How long will this last
without my being sea-sick?</p>

<p>Also, How am I "assisting
progress of Military Science?" Balloon calmer, and <i>not</i> wobbling,
thank Heaven! Begin to enjoy the view.
How beastly cold it is up
here, though! Passing over St. Paul's&mdash;suggest to fellow passenger that
with a bomb, or better still a pistol, one could "pot" the
Dome. Passenger (funny man) says, "Why not try a para<i>shoot</i>?"
I laugh heartily, and nearly fall over side. Aëronaut, roughly,
"wishes to goodness I'd keep still." <i>I</i> wish to goodness he'd
make the Balloon keep still&mdash;don't say this, however.</p>

<p>Somewhere over Essex. See distant sea. Aëronaut says, "There's no
end of a wind springing up." Heavens! Believe we are
drifting out to sea! But I didn't want to "assist progress of <i>Naval</i>
Science"&mdash;only "Military." Tell Aëronaut this. He says, he's "just
going down." Talks as if he were "going down" to breakfast&mdash;after "getting up,"
as we have done! Rather a good joke for mid-air.
But is it mid-air? We are descending rapidly. Digestion this time left up in
clouds. Tearing along over fields. Balloon pitching and
tossing violently. Grapnel thrown out. Catches a cow. Cow runs with us. Idiot!
Why can't it stand steady?</p>

<p>Awful crash! Bump, bang, whack! Balloon explodes with fearful report.
Yet no reporters present! Remember nothing more.
Wake up, and find myself in Hospital of an Essex town. Query&mdash;Have I,
or have I not, "assisted the progress of Military Science?"</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p><i>The Marsh King's Daughter.</i> One of <span class="sc">Warne &amp; Co.'s</span>
publications for children's amusement, but the illustrations
by <span class="sc">Jessie Currie</span> are too highly curried, or rather
coloured, and the effect is hard and theatrical. By the
way, Miss <span class="sc">Currie's</span> genius is a trifle wilful; for example,
take this situation, which she has chosen to illustrate,&mdash;"She
... pointed to a horse. He mounted upon
it, and she sprang before him, and held tightly by the
mane." Now, asks the Baron, taking for granted the
"sprang" is for "sprang up," how would ordinary talent
depict this scene? Why, certainly, by showing the girl
mounted on the horse, holding on by the mane in front
of the man, and the man up behind. Not so Miss <span class="sc">Currie</span>.
She puts the good man&mdash;apparently an Amateur Monk&mdash;astride
the horse, and she riding behind, holding lightly
as it appears, with one hand the broad red crupper, and,
with the other, probably, some portion of the Amateur
Monk's dressing-gown. But genius must not be fettered.</p>

<p><i>Æsop Redivivus</i> is delightful, if only for the reappearance
of the quaint old woodcuts&mdash;some of which, however,
the Baron is of opinion, never belonged to the original
edition&mdash;yet, with a polite bow to <span class="sc">Mary Boyle</span>, he
would venture to observe that, in his opinion, the revivification
is an excellent idea rather thrown away.
Whether it would have been better for more or less
Boyleing, he is not absolutely certain, but perhaps the
notion required a somewhat different treatment. The
best of the fables is <i>The Sly Stag</i>, which, according to
the woodcut, ought to have been a goat. But there may
be some subtle humour in the frequent incongruity
between a fable and its pictorial illustration.</p>

<h3>MORE ABOUT TALLEYRAND.</h3>

<h4><i>To the Editor of "Punch."</i></h4>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir,</span>&mdash;You have on many occasions honoured me by inserting
my contributions, and consequently it is to you I turn in the
present difficulty. A few days since an appeal was made in the
columns of one of your contemporaries which it is hard to resist.</p>

<p><i>À propos</i> of the Talleyrand Autobiography a gentleman, who had
given some extracts therefrom, wrote&mdash;"What I have quoted shows
the charm and interest of the work, but does not discount its publication;
and this, I hope, will be enough to enforce on the custodians
of the Memoirs the obligation of reflection before continuing to suppress
and to frustrate the legitimate curiosity of the public." I have
reflected, and, without making any admission, I submit that possibly
the following passages may attain the end which the gentleman in
question seemingly suggests.</p>

<p>When <span class="sc">Talleyrand</span>, in 1801, was at Amiens, assisting <span class="sc">Joseph
Bonaparte</span> in conducting negotiations with Lord <span class="sc">Cornwallis</span> for
the final ratification of peace, he had an interview with the representative
of England. I give a translation from a paper in my
possession:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"It was already the everlasting opposition of maritime and manufacturing
towns that prevented this consummation. When Milor (<span class="sc">Cornwallis?</span>)
observed, with insular bluntness (<i>bonhomie</i>), 'The outcome will
be a new throne (<i>encore une chaise bien décoré</i>) for J. B.' I replied, 'This
will certainly not be to the advantage of Son Altesse <span class="sc">Joseph</span> (<i>pas pour
Josê</i>).'"
</p></blockquote>

<p>Does not this read as if written yesterday? Five years later
<span class="sc">Talleyrand</span> entered into a direct communication with Fox by letter,
and this led to a personal interview with Lord <span class="sc">Yarmouth</span>. I make
a second quotation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I told Mister-for-laughter (<i>esquire pour rire</i>) that there would be no
difficulty in restoring to England Hanover, which was then in possession of
Prussia. The Englishman (<i>l'Anglais</i>), who had been imbibing some generous
wine (<i>vin ordinaire à dix sous</i>), stammered out that he considered the
suggestion piscatorial. 'Milor,' I retorted, with a polite bow, 'to a <span class="sc">Yarmouth</span>
accustomed to bloaters all things must appear fishy!'"
</p></blockquote>

<p>Considering <span class="sc">Talleyrand's</span> flexible mind, and the ease with which
he resigned himself to blunders when they did not seem to him dangerous,
this judgment, expressed with surprising emphasis, is the
most striking condemnation which can be passed on the tone adopted
by the British negotiator. With rare skill <span class="sc">Talleyrand</span> avoids the
dryness usual to memoirs of a personal character. As an instance of
this, I give a description of the desertion by the wily diplomatist of
<span class="sc">Napoleon</span> in 1814, when the Emperor had consented to retire to
Elba. That this passage may have additional force, I give it in the
original, possibly very original, French:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Je n'aime pas lui. Je pensais de cet homme qu'il était un espèce de
polichinelle (<i>a quaint sort of puppet</i>), qu'il n'était pas la valeur de son sel
(<i>not the value of his salt</i>), et voilà la raison pourquoi je lui vende (<i>why I
offered him for sale</i>). Il n'a pu supporter la bienfaisance avec satisfaction,
ni les choses bien désagréables avec complaisance."
</p></blockquote>

<p>"He could not bear the things that were disagreeable with complacency."
Volumes might be written on that phrase, which at
this moment, if we look around us, suggests numerous parallel
instances. I have heard a man growl when a plate of soup has been
poured by a careless waiter on his dress waistcoat, I have noticed a
lady frown when I have myself accidentally torn her train from its
body, by treading upon it at an evening party. <span class="sc">Talleyrand</span> knew
<span class="sc">Napoleon</span>&mdash;"He could not bear the things that were disagreeable
with complacency!" And yet <span class="sc">Bonaparte</span> is sometimes called
"<i>Le Grand</i>!" (The Great!)</p>

<p>Here I pause, as I feel that I may have already gone too far. It
is not for me to say how the document from which I have quoted,
came into my possession. But before I satisfy the legitimate curiosity
of the public further, I consider it my professional duty to consult
the Bar Committee, the Council of the Incorporated Law Society,
the President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the
High Court of Justice, and the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>, many of whom
are unfortunately still absent, enjoying the Whitsuntide Vacation.

<h3>A NOVEL WITH A PURPOSE.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch,</span></p>

<p>How a few hundred pounds may be easily and honestly
earned is a problem which daily exercises the imaginations of
thousands. I was fortunate enough to hit upon a plan which I now feel
it to be my duty to make as widely known as possible for the benefit of
those whose need is greater than mine; for, curiously enough, not
only did my work bring me in that direct emolument, upon which I
not unwarrantably reckoned, but an elderly lady of unstable views
was so taken with the chaotic benevolence of my book, that she
bequeathed to me a very handsome legacy indeed, and almost immediately
enabled me to realise it. Thus does the absolutely unexpected
serve as the handmaid of the perfectly unintended, and enterprise
retires from the lodgings of struggle to the villa of repose. My plan
briefly was to write a quasi-religious Novel with a Purpose. I knew
nothing about religion, and had no literary experience, but the
purpose I had, and that purpose was, to
make enough money to spend six weeks
at Herne Bay, a locality to which I am
passionately addicted.</p>

<p>A brief sketch of my proceedings will be
the best explanation and guide to others.
I first bought a sixpenny scrap-album, a
pot of paste, and a pair of strong scissors;
and a shillingsworth of penny novelettes
of various kinds and dates, and a shillingsworth
of cheap manuscript-paper completed
my outlay. I then took the goods home
and got to work. Glancing through the
pile of novelettes, I soon found an opening
that struck me as most suitable, cut it out,
and pasted it in the scrap-book. Now came
the chief literary exercise of my task. I
had to go carefully through the passage,
changing the names of the places and people,
and making a few necessary substitutions,
<i>e.g.</i>, "The cuckoo was calling, and the dove
cooing from the neighbouring woodland,"
would stand in my version "The cuckoo
was cuckooing, and the dove calling from
the adjacent thicket," while a sky described
as "azure" in the original, would figure
as "lapis lazuli," or, even blue.</p>

<p>The introduction safely engineered, I took
another novelette from the pile, and holding
it firmly in the left hand, I grasped the
scissors with the thumb and forefinger of the
right, cut three or four extracts at random,
of rather more than half a column in length,
and pasted these in the album, leaving about
space enough for a couple of pages of three-volume
novel, between each section.</p>

<p>Thus I dealt with my twelve novelettes, and then went through
them again, and even again. Then the hard work began. I had to
draw up a list of names of my own, and then to go carefully through
the extracts, assigning the speeches to the best of my ability to the
most suitable of my own characters. This, however, was infinitely
less trouble than inventing dialogue, a process for which I always
entertained an insuperable aversion. I was also confronted at times
by adventures in my extracts which were quite unsuited for the
novel with a purpose, which, according to the justest canons, should
never get beyond a sprained ankle; and even that has to be handled
with the greatest discretion&mdash;generally by the wavering curate. So
I had in several places to tone down precipices, stay the inflowing
tide with more success than King <span class="sc">Canute</span>, and stop runaway horses
before they had excited alarm in their fair riders, or brought the
discarded lover out into the road, saying in a tone of quiet command,
"Stop! This cannot be allowed to go any farther."</p>

<p>Next, through the kindness of a friend, who was a householder, I
procured a reading ticket for the British Museum Library, and from
the writings of <span class="sc">Herbert Spencer</span>, <span class="sc">Huxley</span>, <span class="sc">Emerson</span>,
<span class="sc">Matthew
Arnold</span>, <span class="sc">Ruskin</span>, Dr. <span class="sc">Momerie</span>, and Mr. <span class="sc">Walter
Pater</span>, and
largely from the more pretentious Reviews and Magazines, I made
copious and tolerably bewildering extracts, which I apportioned
among the vacant spaces in my story, with more regard to the
length than to the circumstances. I next went carefully over the
whole, writing in a line here and there to make things smooth and
pleasant, and artfully acknowledging the quotations in an incidental
manner. The result was a surprisingly interesting and suggestive
work, and when I had copied it all out in a fair, clerkly hand, I
found no difficulty in disposing of it, to good advantage, to a
publisher of repute. The book caught on immensely. I became
for one dazzling season a second-rate lion of the first magnitude.
I was pointed out by literary celebrities whom nobody knew, to
social recruits who knew nobody. I figured prominently in the
Saloons of the Mutual-exploitation Societies, and when my name
appeared in the minor Society papers among those present at Mrs.
<span class="sc">Ophir Crowdy's</span> reception, I felt what it was to be famous&mdash;and
to remain unspoiled.</p>

<p>A word of advice to those who will act upon my suggestions.
Pitch your story in the calm domestic key, upon which the depths
and obscurities of essayists, philosophers and divines, will come with
pleasing incongruity. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Chapter I.</span></h4>

<p>"An English Summer day; old <i>Ponto</i> has been lying in the shade
of the great elm at the Rectory Gate, too lazy to make even a
vigorous snap at the flies, who are circling with mazy persistency
round his great, good-humoured head. At the sound of wheels
coming along the road, he pricks up his ears, and moves aside just
in time to avoid being run over by the chaise from the Hall." Then
the rattle of teacups, and the merry voices of tennis-players are
interrupted by the barking of <i>Ponto</i>, and
the incident of the tramp, lectured by the
Rector, and relieved by <span class="sc">Lionel</span>, the philanthropic
Atheist.</p>

<p>"'I love the Human, I resent the Divine!'
said <span class="sc">Lionel</span>, carefully shutting his purse.</p>

<p>"'Why, really,' began the Rector, 'I
don't know what I have done to incur your
resentment.'</p>

<p>"'Pardon me, Sir,' said <span class="sc">Lionel</span>, grimly.
'I am speaking of the Divine with a big <i>D</i>.'</p>

<p>"'We never use a big, big <i>D</i>,' laughed
<span class="sc">Nettie</span>, gaily shaking her curls.</p>

<p>"'Hush!' said <span class="sc">Mabel</span>, raising a warning
finger at her little rattle-brain."</p>

<p>After this sally you may give two or
three pages of discussion, letting the Rector
have a good show with some of the Fathers,
while <span class="sc">Nettie</span> and <span class="sc">Lionel</span> reconstruct things,
human and divine, in the gloaming. You
may carry your party to town in the season,
and tantalise your frivolous readers by
taking them just up to the Duchess's door.
"Here <span class="sc">Lionel</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Crumpetter</span> left
the ladies, as they had some important
business in hand, promising to return for
them at six o'clock. They had to go to
an architect's office in Great George Street,
to inspect the plans of the new Laundry,
which <span class="sc">Lionel</span> had persuaded the Earl to
erect on the waste ground where he had had
his memorable conversation with the tinker."</p>

<p>This plan might advantageously be applied
to the fashionable, the military, the sporting,
and the adventurous novel. Indeed,
most writers seem to think that it has been.
Meanwhile, nobody need starve while they can turn their scissors
to intelligent use. Yours obediently,</p>
